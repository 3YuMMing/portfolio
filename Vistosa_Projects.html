        <p>&nbsp &nbsp This is my first project, while working on this project I
        was really confused because I have never coded before so with no knowledge
        I had my partner do most of the work...true story. while making this game 
        I had a better understanding of coding and how it works, also experiencing 
        programming games works and how simple things can be the hardest to code in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp This game is called "BEBE" and this game was made in CSP,
        the game was made on September 7,2018. What this game is about
        is that the player has to go through level but as it continues it gets
        harder but with a code we were stuck on we could not make a properly 
        made game. Your goal of this game is to basically reach the end that's it.
        A challenge we came across is the sprite recognizing the ground, that
        code alone probably took most of the class work days. Even though I didn't
        really help we did have teamwork making the game like how the map was going
        to be desinged. The challenges we faced were having the sprite recognize
        the ground (we never got it to work), how high you should jump, and how
        it was going to start. With these problems we we only able to get some
        of these to work. If you play the game there are many bugs you can
        exploit to win the game, and the anwser for that is that we spent a long
        time tring to fix the sprite recognizing the ground without breaking 
        another code.</p>
