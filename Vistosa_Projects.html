        <p>&nbsp &nbsp This is my first project, while working on this project I
        was really confused because I have never coded before so with no knowledge
        I had my parther do most of the work...true story. But some skills I learned
        while doing this project I had a better understanding of coding and how it
        works, I also learned how programming games works and how simple things
        can be the hardest to put in.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp This game is called "BEBE" and this game was made in computer
        science, the game was made on September 7,2018. What this game is about
        is that the player has to go through level but as it continues it gets
        harder but with a code we were stuck on we could not make a properly 
        made game. Your goal of this game is to basically reach the end thats it
        A challenge we came across is the sprit recognizing the ground, that
        code alone probably took most of the class work days. Even though I did
        really help we did have teamwork making the game like how the make was going
        to be desinged what ideas we had,etc. Warning: if you do play this game
        you will experience a lots of bouncing because we could not get the floor
        to work properly.(Warning:The game has many bugs and was not finsihed)</p>
