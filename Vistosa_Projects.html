              <p>&nbsp &nbsp This is my first project, while working on this project I
          was really confused because I have never coded before so with no knowledge
          I had my partner do most of the work...true story. while making this game 
          I had a better understanding of coding and how it works, also experiencing 
          programming games works and how simple things can be the hardest to code in.
          </p>
              <p>&nbsp &nbsp This game is called "BEBE" and this game was made in CSP,
          the game was made on September 7,2018. What this game is about
          is that the player has to go through level but as it continues it gets
          harder but with a code we were stuck on we could not make a properly 
          made game. Your goal of this game is to basically reach the end that's it.
          A challenge we came across is the sprite recognizing the ground, that
          code alone probably took most of the class work days. Even though I didn't
          really help we did have teamwork making the game like how the map was going
          to be desinged. The challenges we faced were having the sprite recognize
          the ground (we never got it to work), how high you should jump, and how
          it was going to start. With these problems we we only able to get some
          of these to work. If you play the game there are many bugs you can
          exploit to win the game, and the anwser for that is that we spent a long
          time tring to fix the sprite recognizing the ground without breaking 
          another code.</p>
          <strong><a href="https://ide.c9.io/yum3ming/csp1-vistosa-j-python"target="_blank">Text Adventure</a></strong>
              <p>&nbsp &nbsp This is my first python, it is named Red Dead it 
              was a sucessful project that was mostly done by my partner because
              he had a better understanding of python than me. I did kind of 
              help with the theme of the textadventure but overall he did most 
              of the work, I would try to typebut I wouldn't know how to start 
              it, so I left the typing to himand said some ideas in the making 
              of this text adventure.There wasnot that much problems because 
              this is basically the same codeover and over again using different 
              text and asking yes or no questions to determine the output of on 
              how the story goes whichwas a good idea made by my partner. 
              My partner made the startingpart very nice, he included ascii art 
              which was a nice part and people thought it was cool,</p>
