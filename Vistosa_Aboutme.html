                <p>&nbsp &nbsp As a freshmen in high school I am unsure on what 
                I would want to do career wise. However I recently got interested 
                in competitive gaming because of 1.Gaming and 2.Not many people
                see gaming as a actual sport, I want to make competitive
                gaming not look like a activity that parents see as a waste of
                time. To achive this goal I would have to practice my communtication
                and other skills I lack in and I would also have to play games
                like they I am facing really good players. This is my goal because
                gaming is an activity that is both fun and quite challenging 
                which I like because I can learn new things I didn't know already
                and improve on skills that need improving.</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp Some experience I have dealing with games is that
                I have competed in a mini OverWatch tournament with my cousins
                on Xbox, at that time I have not played on Xbox a lot so I had to
                adapt to using a Xbox One controller and we won going undefeated.
                Another tournament I've competed in with the same cousins is a
                Fortnite tournament while doing that tournament I had to be patient
                and make smart plays to get the upper hand on people I also learned
                how to be a team player since Fortnite is team based game.</p>
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp A major accomplishment I want to achive while in
                high school is to maintain a least a 3.7 gpa for the rest of my
                high school year. Since I am a freshmen I haven't had the time
                to participate in activities but hopefully in the future I hope
                to participate is some activities. Some things that I have learned
                about myself is that I like to spar as in marital arts, also
                I like to play most sports with friends, a class I find difficult
                every year for me is science,biology realted stuff. For some 
                reason those type of class I have the hardest time in. Lastly I
                get bored easily for a example during most class expect for CSP,
                PE, and Spanish.</p>
